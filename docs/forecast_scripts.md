# Forecast Scripts

These forecasting utilities read Excel workbooks and output new workbooks with predicted values.

## Usage

All scripts accept the same two command line options:

```bash
python FY-forecast.py --data data.xlsx --output forecasts.xlsx
```

Replace the script name with `FY-forecast-v2.py`, `FY-forecast-v3.py` or `TS-Forecast.py` as needed.  `--data` specifies the path to the input Excel file and `--output` is the file that will be written.
